#ExpandableRecyclerView

Library to create two level expandable RecyclerView.

### Implementation

This POC uses *TwoLevelExpandableAdapter* as the base class and override a couple of methods there.

Also you need to provide *ViewHolders* for top and second level of list hierarchy. Both of them must be child of *ViewHolderWithSetter*
